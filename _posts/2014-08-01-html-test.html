<h3>This is a sample post using html.</h3>
<strong>Strong text</strong> is just like <b>bold text</b> but is prefered.

<br> <!--line break-->

<p>Paragraphs may have different stylings than other texts. It's good to deliniate blocks of text with semantic tags so the proper css can be applied. And always close your tags</p>

<p style="font-family:fantasy;margin:0 20px;">Styles/fonts can be defined inline for individual elements. Inline styles always overwrite styles in the css file. Note: don't use the &lt;font&gt; tag, it's depricated.</p>
