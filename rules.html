  <p>In a nutshell, the goal of Beat the Banker is to run out of cards first by playing sequences of cards out of you hand. Beat the Banker pits one player—the Banker—on a team against two Workers. If either Worker runs out first, both win. If the Banker is the first to go out, they win.</p>
  <h2 id="play">PLAY</h2>
  <dl>
    <dt>Dealing</dt>
    <dd>17 cards are dealt to each player and the final three cards are set aside to be given to the player who wins the Bid to be the Banker.</dd>
    <dt>Bidding</dt>
    <dd>Players can bid 1, 2 or 3. The highest bidder becomes the Banker. 3 is the maximum bid and anyone who bids 3 becomes the Banker immediately. The Bid determines the first multiplier on the Stakes.</dd>
    <dt>Playing</dt>
    <dd>The Banker is given the three extra cards and gets to play the first hand. The Banker starts with an Open Table, meaning they can play any hand that is valid. Open Tables also occur whenever both other players pass after you play.</dd>
    <dd>Once the Banker plays, the play moves clockwise to the next player and they have a chance to match the hand played by the Banker with higher cards. The hand format being played cannot change until someone gets an Open Table and plays a new hand.</dd>
    <dt>Ending the Game</dd>
      <dd>The game ends when the Banker runs out of cards or when either of the two Workers runs out of cards.</dd>
      <dt>Payout</dt>
      <dd>The payout is determined by the base stakes, the bid, and if any extra multipliers occurred during the game. The Stakes is first multiplied by the bid. Each Bomb or Nuke played multiplies the Stakes by 2. If a Bank Run occurs—if the Banker is the only one to play and wins, or if the Banker only plays on their first Open Table and loses—then the stakes are multiplied by 2 as well.</dd>
      <dd>Once the final stakes are calculated, the winner of the game is paid. If the Banker wins, each Worker pays the stakes to the Banker. If the Banker wins, they pay the total stakes to each Worker. The Banker always has the most to lose or gain!</dd>

  <h2 id="hands">HANDS</h2>
  Every hand in Beat the Banker must be in one of the following shapes:
  <br>
  <img src="../images/hands_610-349.png" alt="Single, pair, triple, triple kicker, full house, bomb, straight, pair straight, tripple double, nuke">
  <ul>
    <li>Aces are high and Jokers are higher. The Red Joker beats the Black Joker.</li>
    <li>Bombs can be played on any hand and are only beaten by higher Bombs or the Nuke.</li>
    <li>The Nuke is the highest Bomb and is unbeatable.</li>
    <li>Bombs and Nukes double the stakes when played.</li>
    <li>The Bomb can be played with 2 Kickers or 2 Pairs, but it loses its Bomb properties.</li>
    <li>A Straight, Pair Straight or Triple Double can use as many consecutive cards as the player chooses.</li>
    <li>A Triple Double played with Kickers or pairs must have as many Kickers or Pairs as it has consecutive Triples.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="types">GAME TYPES</h2>
  <p>In the Beat the Banker app, players have three choices for how they want to play: Instant Match, Practice, or Group Match.</p>
