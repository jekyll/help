<p>Though Beat the Banker is an easy game to learn, it is a tough game to master! There’s a lot to consider when bidding and playing your cards.</p>

  <h2 id = "bidding">BIDDING</h2>
  <p>Knowing when to bid and when to pass is a crucial Skill. Always look closely at your cards and try to plan an ideal way to play them. Think about how you’ll take control of the table and ensure you’ll have an Open Table. Look for things like Pairs of Aces, Jokers, or lots of Kings to see if you have a good hand.</p>

  <p>Generally-speaking, if you have a Bomb or Nuke in your hand, you should strongly consider bidding. On the other hand, if you have no high cards and can’t keep control of the Open Table after you bomb, it’s a better idea to let someone else bid and then take control from them.</p>

  <p>Another way to think of it is in terms of the value of your cards. If the Red Joker is worth 4 points, the Black Joker is worth 3, Aces are worth 2 and Kings are worth 1, then it’s a good idea to bid if you have over 7 points.</p>

  <p>Always consider what your lower cards are. In any situation, if you have a big mix of pairs and singles that can’t be chained together, it’s not a good idea to bid unless you have a surefire way to maintain control.</p>

  <p>Don’t forget, you have to account for the three extra cards when bidding to be the Banker. If you have a perfect hand already, it may be best to pass, then take control and win rather than risking losing because of the extra cards.</p>

  <p>The most important thing to keep in mind when playing is how you can take control of the table. An Open Table is a great way to both play low cards and to set up control later. If you have low pairs and high pairs, play the low pairs first, then retake control with a high pair.</p>
  <p>Be aware of how many cards other players have. If you all have over ten cards, it’s usually better to play low cards whenever you can to get rid of them. On the other hand, if someone has a lot fewer cards than you, try to think about how you can prevent them from playing more by playing big hands like straights.</p>
  <p>When you’re a Worker, don’t forget that if either you or the other Worker goes out, both of you win. If the other Worker is playing a lot of cards and looks like they might run out first, try to help them go out by playing low cards to set them up when you are in control.</p>
  <p>Another important skill is keeping track of which high cards have been played. This is useful because it can allow you to take control even when you’re not playing your highest cards. For example, if someone takes control with a single Ace then plays a pair and you have a pair of Aces and a pair of Kings, your Kings can’t be beat since only one other Ace is in the game. Play your Kings and save your Aces for later.</p>
  <p>If you don’t win Banker, be sure to keep in mind which cards the Banker has won. You may be able to predict certain plays depending on which cards you have seen played and the three cards you know the Banker has.</p>
  <p>Keep in mind that playing single cards is the toughest way to maintain control of the table, especially if you don’t have the Red Joker. When playing straights, try to keep in mind how many pairs or higher you’re breaking up—sometimes it’s better to play the pairs instead of the straight.</p>
  <p>Bombs and Nukes are another important factor in strategy. Before you play your Bomb, think about how likely it is someone else has a Bomb or Nuke, and also how likely it’ll be that you’ll win. You don’t want to Bomb, double the stakes, then lose! </p>
  <p>Don’t forget a Bomb can be played with two kickers or two pairs instead. It negates the Bomb status (no stakes doubled and can’t be played on any hand) but if you only have a Bomb and three low singles left, it may be smarter to forgo the double stakes in favor of a guaranteed win by playing the Bomb+Kickers then your final single.</p>
  <p>If you’re playing a single card and you have an Ace and the Black Joker but the Red Joker hasn’t been played, play the Ace first. The Red Joker player will have to play it if they want control and afterwards you’ll have the strongest card left in the game.</p>
  <p>When you have multiple plays with one hand, think carefully about how you want to set play them out. For example, if you have 2344556678, it’s better to split the Pair Straight up into two straights—23456 and 45678. This way you won’t be left over with any pesky singles.</p>
